The theory of production analyzes the way in which the given producer "the state of the art or the technology, combines several inputs to produce a stipulated quantity in an economically efficient way". <br> <br>

Every society has to organize in some way the productive process to adequately solve the fundamental economic problems. But regardless of the organization that is adopted, there are certain universal economic principles that govern the productive process. The production of goods and services may be in the hands of the State, as in the communist system; or in the hands of private enterprise, as in the capitalist system. But in both cases the productive activity is conditioned by certain laws or general principles that the employer must take into consideration if he wishes to achieve the most effective use of the economic resources at his disposal; that is, achieve maximum production with the maximum economy, under any type of socio-economic organization. <br> <br>

             These costs correspond to resources that participate in the production process but that do not physically incorporate the final product, since they are linked to the process but not to the product as such.
             <br>
             They can be divided into: <br> Semi-direct: Those that do not apply to the product, but to the cost system. <br>
Indirect: They are not direct to the product nor to the system. They are common to two or more products, so they require some distribution criteria.

             Distribution costs are all disbursements incurred by a producer to deliver its products, from its manufacturing plant to the place where they are acquired, thus constituting a fundamental component of the total cost to the producer and the price paid by the producers. consumers, so their analysis is very important in terms of business efficiency.
